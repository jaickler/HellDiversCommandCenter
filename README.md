# Hell Divers Command Center
*The central command for all strategic operations.*

## Our Mission
At Hell Divers Command Center, our unwavering mission is to rally the courageous souls of our Hell Divers in a relentless pursuit of victory against the despicable scourges of the Automatons and the Terminids. With steely determination and unyielding resolve, we shall provide our valiant warriors with the tools and intelligence necessary to seize every strategic advantage on the battlefield. Our sacred duty is to thwart the nefarious schemes of J.O.E.L. (Joint Offensive Extraterrestrial Liaison) and ensure the triumph of humanity over the forces of darkness. United under the banner of liberty and justice, we stand as guardians of our cherished world, ready to sacrifice all in defense of freedom and the future of our civilization.
To do this we have compiled all information from across Super Earth's various scouts and sensors to determine when and where you need to be to help spread freedom.
